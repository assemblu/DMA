# DMA
 Open source DMA bugfix for STM32 i2s full-duplex transmissions.

 # What bug?
 STM refuses to fix a bug where it occurs when i2s is set to full-duplex mode for stm32f4xx microcontrollers. This is useful for digital signal processing applications. I decided to release this bugfix and opensource it. Enjoy the full callback function now :)
